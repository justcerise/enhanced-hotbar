# Enhanced Hotbar
- Enhanced Hotbar, a texture pack which improves the hot-bar icons and experience bar, alongside some UI elements.
This repository is so you can mark down issues or suggestions for the pack to be added/fixed in future updates.
- _please note, updates will come every once in a while, and not consistently_


**Extra Note:**
_This was previously used as a UI pack for a project called PlushieHavoc, it has since receieved drastic changes._
_so it is now downloadable for all to use! Or so people can use this UI over the new one the project has._
